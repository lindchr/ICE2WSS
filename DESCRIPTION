Description: R package for processing ICESat-2 ATL13 data and computing water surface slopes (WSS) of rivers represented by the SWOT River Database. 
    The package will process a dynamic number of WSS estimates dependent on the user settings for each ICESat-2 overflight of the given SWORD reaches. 
    Input data: The package uses 2 data inputs. water surface elevation measurements and river centerlines. The package is adjusted to ICESat-2 ATL13 and the SWOT River database (SWORD). Other data can be used if the same parameters are available. Aditionally, the water surface occurrence can be included as input data. This is optional. 
    ICESat-2 ATL13 data is available: 			https://nsidc.org/data/data-access-tool/ATL13/versions/5
    SWORD data is available: 					https://zenodo.org/record/7410433
    Water surface occurrence data is available: https://global-surface-water.appspot.com/download
